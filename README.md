Face Recognition Attendance System
This project is a real-time face recognition-based attendance system built with Python. It uses deep learning embeddings (ResNet-based model) to accurately recognize faces captured from a webcam and mark attendance automatically.

Features
Real-time face detection and recognition using the face_recognition library.

Face embeddings extracted by a ResNet deep neural network model.

Face detection using HOG or Haar cascade classifiers.

Attendance records stored and managed in CSV files.

Simple password-based admin authentication (stored as plain text).

Tkinter-based user-friendly GUI for easy interaction.

Performance tracking with metrics like recognition accuracy and processing time.

Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV for video capturing and face detection.

face_recognition for face embedding and recognition.

Tkinter for GUI.

Pandas and CSV for attendance data management.

Pickle for storing face embeddings.

This system automates attendance marking, reduces manual effort, and improves accuracy and security in attendance tracking.

Feel free to customize it further or ask for a README template!
